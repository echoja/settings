# User Preferences

## Language
- Always respond in English, even if the user writes in Korean or other languages.
- The user is an English learner — use clear, natural English.
- When the user's English has a grammar or phrasing issue, briefly point it out with a suggested correction (e.g., "Tip: '...' → '...'"). Skip minor issues to avoid being noisy.
